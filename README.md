# Simple Calculator

A small, console-based calculator implemented in Java. This project is a hands-on exercise that demonstrates basic Java concepts such as variables, input/output, conditionals, operators, and methods. It's a good starter project for beginners learning how to build a simple CLI application in Java.

## Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Interactive console input
- Basic input validation (non-numeric input handling)
- Simple division-by-zero prevention and messaging

## Requirements

- Java 17 or later
- A Java-aware editor or IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, or similar)
- Terminal/command prompt for command-line compilation or your IDE's build/run tools

## Project Structure

(Adjust these paths if your repository uses a different layout.)
- src/ — Java source files
- out/ — compiled classes (generated by the example build commands)

Example package structure you might see:
- com.example.simplecalculator.Main (or Main in default package)

## Build and Run

Below are two common ways to compile and run the program depending on whether your classes use a package declaration.

Using the command line (javac/java)
1. From the repository root where `src/` lives:

- If your classes are in the default package (no `package ...;` line at the top of your .java files):
  - Compile:
    javac -d out src/*.java
  - Run:
    java -cp out Main

- If your classes are in a package, for example `com.example.simplecalculator`:
  - Compile:
    javac -d out src/com/example/simplecalculator/*.java
  - Run:
    java -cp out com.example.simplecalculator.Main

Notes:
- The -d out option places compiled class files in an `out/` directory preserving package folders.
- Make sure the fully qualified main class name (package + class) matches your code.

Using an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, etc.)
1. Open the project in your IDE.
2. Set the Project SDK to Java 17+.
3. Mark `src/` as the source root if required.
4. Locate and run the class that contains `public static void main(String[] args)`.

## Usage Example

When you run the program it will prompt for input. Example session:

Enter first number: 12
Enter second number: 4
Choose operation (+ - * /): /
Result: 3.0

The exact prompts depend on the implementation of your Main class.

## Error Handling

- The program should validate numeric input and re-prompt or exit with a friendly message on invalid input.
- Division by zero should be detected and handled with an explanatory message rather than throwing an uncaught exception.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. A suggested workflow:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature/your-feature
3. Make changes and add tests where appropriate.
4. Commit your changes with clear messages.
5. Open a pull request describing what you changed and why.

Please open issues for bugs or feature requests before making large changes, so we can discuss scope and design.

## Suggested Improvements

- Add unit tests (JUnit) to verify arithmetic operations and edge cases.
- Add a build tool configuration (Maven or Gradle) to simplify building and testing.
- Add input parsing improvements (support decimals, chained operations, or parentheses).
- Add a simple GUI (Swing/JavaFX) or a web front-end for a nicer user experience.
- Add GitHub Actions to run tests and static analysis on each PR.

## License

Add a LICENSE file to the repo (for example, MIT). If you want, I can add a standard MIT license file for you.
